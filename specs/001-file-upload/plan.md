# Implementation Plan: File Upload Web Application

**Branch**: `001-file-upload` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-file-upload/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Simple web application for file uploads supporting both browser-based HTML form upload and curl POST requests. Purpose: debugging and troubleshooting file upload functionality across different hosting environments. Includes containerization via Docker and Kubernetes deployment via Helm charts.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ or Python 3.11+ (simple HTTP server)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (net/http for Go or http.server for Python)
**Storage**: Local filesystem in /uploads directory
**Testing**: curl commands for integration testing
**Target Platform**: Docker container, deployable to Kubernetes
**Project Type**: web (simple server + HTML frontend)
**Performance Goals**: Handle 10MB files, 10 concurrent uploads
**Constraints**: <500ms response time, pure HTML frontend, no JavaScript frameworks
**Scale/Scope**: Single container, stateless design, debug tool scope

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
✅ **PASS**: Using pure HTML, standard library HTTP server, no frameworks
- Single HTML page with form
- Basic HTTP POST endpoint
- Minimal Docker image
- Simple Helm chart

### II. Single Responsibility
✅ **PASS**: Each component has one clear role
- HTML form: file selection UI
- POST endpoint: receive and save files
- Dockerfile: containerization
- Helm chart: K8s deployment

### III. Minimal Dependencies
✅ **PASS**: Zero external dependencies
- Standard library only
- Alpine base image for Docker
- No npm, pip, or other package managers needed

### IV. Progressive Enhancement
✅ **PASS**: Starting with simplest solution
- Basic file upload first
- Can add features later if needed (logging, metrics)
- Backward compatible design

### V. Explicit Over Implicit
✅ **PASS**: Clear, obvious behavior
- Simple HTML form action
- Direct file save to disk
- Clear README with curl examples
- Obvious configuration via environment variables

**Constitution Compliance**: FULL PASS - Design exemplifies KISS principles

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Phase 0 Research: COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 1 Design: COMPLETE
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Phase 2 Planning: READY

## Phase 0: Research

### Technology Selection
Given the KISS principle and requirements:
- **Server Language**: Go (single binary, no runtime dependencies)
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5 with native form elements
- **Container**: Alpine Linux (minimal size)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (native to repository)

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Single Binary Server**: Embed HTML in Go binary for zero-dependency deployment
2. **Stateless Design**: Files saved to mounted volume, container remains stateless
3. **Health Check**: Simple /health endpoint for K8s probes
4. **Configuration**: 3 environment variables max (PORT, UPLOAD_DIR, MAX_SIZE)

### Integration Requirements
- GitHub Actions workflow for Docker build/push
- OCI registry support for Helm chart distribution
- Standard K8s primitives only (Deployment, Service)

## Phase 1: Design

### Contracts
See [contracts/](./contracts/) directory for API specifications.

### Data Model
See [data-model.md](./data-model.md) for entity definitions.

### Quick Start Guide
See [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) for deployment instructions.

### Agent Guidance
See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for implementation guidance.

## Phase 2: Task Generation Approach

The task breakdown will follow this structure:
1. **Core Server Implementation** - Basic HTTP server with upload endpoint
2. **HTML Interface** - Simple form page
3. **Docker Setup** - Containerization and image build
4. **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline for image publishing
5. **Helm Chart** - Kubernetes deployment manifests
6. **Documentation** - README with usage examples

Each task will be atomic, testable, and under 200 lines to comply with constitution.
