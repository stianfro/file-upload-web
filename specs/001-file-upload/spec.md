# Feature Specification: File Upload Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-file-upload`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a simple web-based application where a user can upload arbitrary files. Must be created without any fancy web frameworks, use pure html if possible."

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Summary

A minimalist web application that allows users to upload files of any type to a server. The application prioritizes simplicity and reliability over advanced features, using pure HTML without modern web frameworks.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary Use Case
**As a** user
**I want to** upload files through a web interface
**So that** I can store files on the server

### User Workflow
1. User navigates to the upload page
2. User selects a file from their device
3. User initiates the upload
4. System processes and stores the file
5. User receives confirmation of successful upload

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Upload a small text file (< 1MB)
2. **Large File**: Upload a larger file [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size limit]
3. **Multiple Files**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single vs multiple file upload support]
4. **File Types**: Upload various file types (.txt, .pdf, .jpg, .zip, etc.)
5. **Error Cases**: Network interruption during upload

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- **F1**: Display a file selection interface
- **F2**: Accept file selection from user's device
- **F3**: Upload selected file to server
- **F4**: Store uploaded file [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage location/structure]
- **F5**: Provide upload status feedback to user
- **F6**: Display success/failure message after upload attempt

### File Handling
- **F7**: Support arbitrary file types (no restriction on extensions)
- **F8**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file size limits]
- **F9**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: duplicate file handling]

### User Interface
- **F10**: Single page interface for upload functionality
- **F11**: File selection control (browser native)
- **F12**: Upload trigger mechanism (button/form submission)
- **F13**: Progress indication [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: real-time progress vs. simple loading state]

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Upload response time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable latency]
- Concurrent upload support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single user or multiple users]

### Reliability
- Upload failure recovery [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retry mechanism needed?]
- Data integrity verification [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: checksums/validation needed?]

### Security
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication requirements]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file type validation/scanning]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: access control for uploaded files]

### Constraints
- Pure HTML implementation (no modern frameworks)
- Minimal JavaScript if necessary for form submission
- Standard HTTP form-based file upload

## Data Model

### File Entity
- Filename (original name from user)
- File size
- Upload timestamp
- File type/MIME type
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: unique identifier generation]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user association if any]

## Edge Cases

- Empty file upload attempt
- Upload with no file selected
- Browser compatibility issues
- Server storage full scenario
- Network timeout during upload
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent uploads from same user]

## Out of Scope

- File preview functionality
- File download/retrieval
- File management (delete, rename, move)
- User accounts and authentication (unless clarified)
- File sharing between users
- Advanced upload features (drag-and-drop, chunked upload)
- Client-side file validation beyond basic selection

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can select a file using standard browser file input
2. Selected file uploads successfully to server
3. User receives clear confirmation of upload status
4. System handles common file types without errors
5. Upload interface works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
