## Core Principles

### I. KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
Every solution must be as simple as possible, but no simpler. Complexity
must be justified by clear, measurable benefits. When in doubt, choose the
simpler path. This is the foundational principle from which all others derive.

### II. Single Responsibility
Each component, function, and module does one thing well. No multi-purpose
utilities. Clear boundaries between concerns. If you can't explain what
something does in one sentence, it's too complex.

### III. Minimal Dependencies
External dependencies must be critically evaluated. Every library added
increases attack surface, maintenance burden, and complexity. Build only
what's needed, use only what's essential.

### IV. Progressive Enhancement
Start with the simplest working solution. Add features only when proven
necessary. Every enhancement must maintain backward compatibility unless
breaking changes are explicitly justified and documented.

### V. Explicit Over Implicit
Code clarity trumps cleverness. No magic. No hidden behaviors. Configuration
should be obvious. Errors should be clear. Documentation should be unnecessary
because the code explains itself.

## Development Standards

### Testing Philosophy
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Focus on integration over unit tests
- Tests must be simpler than the code they test
- If a test is hard to write, the code is too complex

### Code Review Requirements
- Every PR must reduce or maintain complexity
- No PR exceeds 200 lines without justification
- Complex logic requires inline documentation
- Performance optimizations require benchmarks

## Operational Guidelines

### Deployment Simplicity
- Single command deployment
- Rollback capability within 60 seconds
- No more than 3 configuration parameters
- Environment parity from development to production

### Monitoring Essentials
- Log errors, not everything
- Three golden metrics: availability, latency, error rate
- Alerts only for actionable problems
- Debug mode toggleable without rebuild

## Governance

### Amendment Process
- Proposed changes must demonstrate simplification benefit
- Complexity additions require 2x value justification
- All amendments require working code examples
- Version bumps follow semantic versioning

### Compliance Verification
- All PRs must reference constitution compliance
- Complexity metrics tracked and reported
- Regular simplification sprints scheduled
- Technical debt explicitly justified or eliminated

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Removing principles or incompatible simplifications
- MINOR: Adding principles or new simplification guidelines
- PATCH: Clarifications and wording improvements
